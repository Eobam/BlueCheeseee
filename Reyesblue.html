<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Pasteurized cow milk from the farms Holstein cattle is used, only the milk from the farm the cheese is made at to ensure freshness and quality. Mold starters are added to the milk before curdling. Once curds are cut, they are very gently stirred together, then allowed to firm before being drained. After this they are pressed into molds then pierced so the mold can activate. They are then aged for 3-6 months (depending on time of year). They are aged in highly controlled caves.</p>
