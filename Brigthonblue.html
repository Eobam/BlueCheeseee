<h3>History:</h3>
<p>Brigthon blue is a recently created cheese by High Weald Dairy, which is made in West Sussex County. The cheese was created in 2005 and won Super Gold at the World Cheese Awards in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Stilton Blue is made with pasteurized milk. Once the molds are made for the cheese, they are turned over multiple times to begin the process. Once they start to take shape, special needles are put in to let air get in, whcih is what creates the blue mold. They have a short aging time of about 4-8 weeks.</p>
