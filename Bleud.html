<h3>History:</h3>
<p>Bleu d'Auvergne was created in the 1850's by Antoine Roussel. Roussel created the cheese when experimenting with making moldy cheese and he figured out theat adding rye bread would increase the amount of blue veins, as well as that poking tiny holes in the curds would help mold grow faster and larger.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Cold raw cow's milk is used, before curdling, mold starter is also added. Once curdling is done curds are harvested, cut and drained. After this they are stirred together, then placed in molds. Once the cheese is placed in aging cellars, which are cool and humid, the cheese is penetrated by small needles to let air come in. The cheese is aged for approximately 4 weeks.</p>
