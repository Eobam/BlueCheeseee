<h3>History:</h3>
<p>The cheese was created around 2005 as a result of the Jasper Hill Farm's exploration into blue cheese making. The cheese was named after a Revoulationary-War era trade route near the farm. After a couple of years, the cheese became the farm's flagship cheese. Eventually, in 2014, the cheese found success in competition, winning world's best unpasteurized cheese and Super Gold at the World Cheese Awards as well as Best in Class at the World Championship Cheese Contest. It also later won the Reserve Supreme champion at the International Cheese Awards in 2019, Super Gold and Best American cheese at the World Cheese Awards in 2024.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>The cheese uses raw cow milk from Jasper Hill Farms in Vermont. Mold is then added to the milk with rennet to curdle the milk. Once curds are harvested, they are stirred and slightly heated while being stirred together. After that, the cheese is carefully put into molds. After the cheese hardens, holes are pierced to activate the mold. The cheese in normally aged for about 3 months in cellars with high humidity.</p>
