<h3>History:</h3> 
<p>Beenleigh was originally produced by Robin Congdon in 1978 who was a pioneer of the comeback of sheep milk cheese during the '70's in England. Today the cheese is made by Ticklemore Cheese, specifically Tom and Helen Garland who began producing sheep milked cheese (indcluding Beenleigh), in 2011. The cheese won Gold for Sheep milk cheese and Silver for Blue Cheese at the Artisan Cheese Awards in 2019.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3> 
<p>Once curds are made, they are rested for a short period of time before being broken by hand. Then they are placed in molds for roughly 2 days to drain naturally. After being unmolded, needles pierce the cheese. After that, it is placed in a foil and aged for a minimum of 3 months, but normally closer to 6.</p>
