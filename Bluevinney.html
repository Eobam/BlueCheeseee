<h3>History:</h3>
<p>In the beginning, Blue Vinney was just something that was created from the leftover miilk after the making of butter. After a while, once cheese became a mainstream item, Dorset Blue Vinney became a national sensation, specifically in London. There is also a myth/possibility that the cheese was illegal for some time and was sold on a black market. At the beginninng of World War 2, the cheese's production slowed down, but was ramped back up with whole, instead of skim milk, in the 1980's by Woodbridge Farms.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Whether skim milk or whole milk is used, changes depending on producer, but raw milk is always used. Mold spores are added to the curds which are cut into small pieces and let to settle and drain naturally. They are then very loosely packed into molds with minimal touching, they are then left open with some holes in them, and then aged for 12-20 weeks.</p>
