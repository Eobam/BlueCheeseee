<h3>History:</h3>
<p>Cornish Blue was first created in 2001 the Cornish Cheese Compamy. The cheese quickly became a sensation, even winning World Champion Cheese at the World Cheese Awards in 2010.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Pasteurized cow's milk from the Stansfield Farm in Cornwall is used. Mold spores are added to the milk before the curds are cut. After the curds are cut into small cubes, they are heated before draining. They are then let to naturally drain and then placed in moulds and turned over multiple times. After a couple of weeks, holes are placed inside to activate the mold. They are normally aged for 12-14 weeks in controlled temperature rooms.</p>
