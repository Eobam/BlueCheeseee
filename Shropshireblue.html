<h3>History:</h3>
<p>Shropshire Blue has 2 claims of people who are the original creator, both in the 1970's. The first claim is the Andy Williamson while creating Blue Stilton, was experimenting, and created this cheese, which he called "Inverness-shire Blue" or "Blue Stuart". In this claim, it says that after slow sales, the name was changed to Shropshire, even though the cheese and Shropshire county, had no connection. The second claim is that Shropshire-based cheese producer Westry Roberts created it and always called it Shropshire Blue. There is also another variant of the cheese, Ludlow Blue, which is exclusively made in Shropshire. The diffrence in the cheeses is that Ludlow Blue uses a diffrent chemical which makes it a lighter yellow.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Shropshire uses pasteurzed cow milk, which is acquired from specific local farms. Once curds/whey is drained, the are rested and treated to a specific acidity level. They are then broken into lumps, before being molded into molds with air pockets for blue mold to grow. They are aged for 10-12 weeks in cool, humid areas.</p>
