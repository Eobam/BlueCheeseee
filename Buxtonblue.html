<h3>History:</h3>
<p>Buxton Blue was originally created by the J. M. Nuttall Group in 1990. In 1994 the cheese started becoming a nationally eaten cheese (it was before this as well, but much less known) after it won bronze at the British Cheese Awards. After it's newfound popularity, it gained Protected Designation of Origin status, meaning it had to be produced using milk from Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, or Staffordshire for it to be classified as Buxton Blue Cheese. After a 20 year period of slow production and sales, the Mary Button Creamery revived it, and it is still exclusively made by Mary Button.</p>
<h3>How's it made?:</h3>
<p>Same as Stilton but heated before moulding, drained for one day, instead of shorter period and aged for approximately 6 weeks in cool, humid areas.</p>
